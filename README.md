# Discord File Transfer Bot

This is a Python-based Discord bot designed to facilitate large file transfers by breaking them into smaller chunks and sending them via Discord channels. It also includes a command-line interface for easy interaction.

## Features

* **Large File Uploads:** Upload files of virtually any size by splitting them into 10MB chunks.
* **File Downloads:** Download files that were uploaded using the bot.
* **Compression:** Files are compressed using LZMA before uploading to reduce transfer size.
* **User-Friendly CLI:** An interactive command-line interface for choosing between upload and download operations.
* **Progress Animation:** Visual feedback during file operations.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.8+
* `discord.py` library
* `pystyle` library
* `requests` library
* `lzma` (usually built-in with Python)
* `tkinter` (usually built-in with Python for file dialogs)

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install discord.py pystyle requests
````

## Setup

1.  **Create a Discord Bot:**

      * Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
      * Click "New Application" and give your bot a name.
      * Navigate to the "Bot" tab, click "Add Bot", and confirm.
      * **Crucially, enable the "Message Content Intent" and "Guilds Intent" under the "Privileged Gateway Intents" section.**
      * Copy your bot's token.

2.  **Add the Bot to Your Server:**

      * Go to the "OAuth2" -\> "URL Generator" tab.
      * Select `bot` under "Scopes".
      * Under "Bot Permissions", select `Send Messages`, `Manage Channels`, and `Manage Messages` (for pinning).
      * Copy the generated URL and paste it into your browser to invite the bot to your server.

3.  **Configure `main.py`:**

      * Open `main.py`.
      * Replace `"YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"` with your actual Discord bot token:
        ```python
        bot.run("YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE") # Replace with your token
        ```
      * Identify a Discord Guild (server) ID and a channel ID within that guild where the bot will create new channels for file transfers and send initial connection messages. Replace `LOG_CHANNEL_ID` and `GUILD_ID` with your actual IDs:
        ```python
        await bot.get_channel(LOG_CHANNEL_ID).send("connected new user!") # Your channel ID for connection messages
        # ...
        channel = await bot.get_guild(GUILD_ID).create_text_channel(name) # Your guild ID for creating channels
        ```

## Usage

To run the bot, simply execute `main.py`:

```bash
python main.py
```

The bot will connect to Discord, and you will be presented with a menu:

```

  / /(_) __ _| |__ | |_ _ __ (_)_ __   __ _   /\ /\ _ __ | | ___   __ _  __| | ___ _ __

Version 1.1

### Uploading a File

1.  Select option `2` (Upload).
2.  A file dialog will open. Choose the file you wish to upload.
3.  The bot will compress the file, split it into chunks, and upload each chunk to a newly created Discord text channel.
4.  Once complete, a link to a JSON file containing the URLs of all parts will be provided in the console. Share this link for others to download the file.

### Downloading a File

1.  Select option `1` (Download).
2.  Enter the JSON link provided after an upload operation.
3.  The bot will download all parts, decompress them, and reconstruct the original file in the same directory where `main.py` is run.

## Project Structure

  * `main.py`: The main script that handles bot initialization, user interaction, file uploading, and downloading.
  * `logger.py`: Contains utility classes and functions for a custom menu, animation, and colored console output.

## Important Notes

  * **Bot Token Security:** Keep your bot token private. Do not share it publicly.
  * **Discord Rate Limits:** Be mindful of Discord's API rate limits. This bot attempts to handle large files by chunking, but excessive rapid operations might still trigger rate limits.
  * **Channel Management:** The bot creates new channels for each upload. You may want to periodically clean up these channels.
  * **File Size:** While theoretically unlimited, extremely large files might take a significant amount of time to upload/download and consume considerable bandwidth.

## Todo List

  * **Improve Memory Management:** Optimize memory usage, especially when handling very large files, to prevent excessive RAM consumption.
  * Add error handling for network issues during file transfers.
  * Explore options for resuming interrupted downloads.
